# ReinforcementLearning

The purpose of this project is to explore more about reinforcement learning. 
We worked mostly with the cartpole-v0 environment from OpenAI Gym (see https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0 for more information).
The goal of this project is to create a reinforcement learning algorithm that can prevent the pole from falling off the cart.

Explore techniques:

1. Policy gradient method
2. Gradient descent
